# Taxamo Assure PHP Development

As of 1st July 2021 any B2C transaction from outside the EU supplying a customer inside the EU is now liable for the VAT due. They are to charge the customer their local VAT and pay that via an agent registered in the EU. This VAT is paid via the Import One Stop Shop system. You can find more details about this from the EU or Royal Mail here:

Taxamo Assure is a new service from Vertex, it allows you to Pay As You Go. You integrate the solution into your own shopping cart, when the customer places an order you pay Taxamo the VAT and then pay Â£2.00 per delivery. Most other companies charge fixed monthly rates + the VAT.

They have released an API to integrate into your shopping cart software and I have integrated it into ZenCart but am releasing my test code here for others who are looking into it.
